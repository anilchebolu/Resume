Software		: VC++ and C
Duration		: Oct 98 to Jan 99
Team Size		: 3

Description		:
As the name of the project says it is used for network plotting. This software helps in the efficient plotting of design files. The user can select the border of the design files by specifying the output primitives like level, color, style and type of element. When used in the network mode it allows the users to send the plot requests to the server location during which it copies the design files and configuration files to the server location. The server continuously checks for the plot requests and processes the requests and generates the log information.

My Role:
* Implementing the new features requested by the end-users basing on priorities, and maintenance.
* Developing the code fragment that sends the design files to the NetPlot server.
* Testing the issues in NetPlot.

Project Title		: Stereoscopic Model
Client			: Axiom International U.S.A
Operating System	: Windows NT
Software		: C 
Team Size		: 1
Duration		: July 98 to Sep 98

Description		:
The aim of this project is to build a stereoscopic model by placing elements in a design file signifying flight lines and photo centers. These flight lines and photo centers cover any closed region in a design file with an attached digital ‘quad ‘ as a reference file. Finally it prints a report containing the information like Number of flight lines, Number of photo centers, Number of models, Distance between photo centers and flight lines and the total length of the flight lines. This application is used for the survey purpose by the U.S Geographic service.

My Role:

* Designed mathematical algorithms for laying the flight lines and photo centers
* Developing the interface application for MicroStation cad tool using MDL
* Testing the application using different models.

Brain Trust consulting is a software development company having application software for the operations of advertising agencies. The software takes care of different areas of an advertising agency. The company sells the system in the German market. The system was a character user interface. The aim of this project is to build a new user interface called Mask Interpreter, which gives a windows look and brings the client/server technology into the system. The screens, reports and menus were generated from the ASCII text files called mask files, which are sent by the COBOL from the UNIX, where the total functionality lies. The interface is created using Visual C++ through the dynamic object creation, which reads the mask file and designs the screen. The communication between the windows (Client) and UNIX (server) is implemented through TCP/IP and two interface programs at each place. Unix server creates a process each time it listens to a client and the created process communicates with COBOL program using message queues (Inter process communication). Unix server creates a process each time it listens to a client and the created process communicates with COBOL program using message queues (Inter process communication). 


MyRole:
* Developing the mask interpreter that generates screens, reports and menus in windows using VC++  MFC dynamic object creation. 
* Implementing the functionality existing in the old system.
